Scientific project of handling methylation sequencing data
The project will be bioinformatic and focused on handling large Whole bisulfite genome sequencing data. 
By applying functions such as DAMEfindeR and CGmaptools to assign Allele-specific methylation scores to the sites in the genome.
This was done by using both the Tuple-based mode and SNP-based mode to identify the scores and have a map of the regions of interest.
By applying a 50%+-10% methylation filter to remove sites with more or less methylation as a baseline for identifying the ICRs. 
In combination with the ASM scores for those regions, it can be used to identify potential imprinted regions of the genome.
